# DroidCarController
As a base，the arduino frameware could control servo and electron speed regulator，and get information from mpu6050 and so on



DroidCarController is a expenimental base，which design for test accel and gyro in ealier version,I using excel and .csv style and c# upper software to process data.



My teacher give me a idea in ealier ,i complete 80% with 1 weak.I added some function to make it could receive command,running throw series command,like a controller,not a mpu6050 data port only.




#Some function introduction


1.Output information from serial


2.Could control servo and electron speed regulator with standard port(not only pwm port) 


3.Receive serial command and control
